# Spontaneous Synchronization of Fireflies

Fireflies synchronize their flashes as a part of their breeding.
This is a model simulating their synchronizing through time, to test what affects the synchronization (e.g how long does it take to synchronize some amount of fireflies if they are spaced out/can see further etc.)
